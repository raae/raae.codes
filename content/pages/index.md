# Hello there,

I create robust **web apps** and **Gatsby plugins**.

Roughly half the year I work as an **independent contractor**. The rest of my time I spend on **family**, **learning**, **speaking** and **open source**.

My full name is Benedicte Raae.  
My location is Rodel√∏kka, Oslo, Norway.

## POW! - take charge of your menstrual cycle

Creating a menstrual tracker app has been in the back of my mind for years. First, because I wanted something more straightforward and flexible, then later the lack of privacy afforded by existing apps got me curious about encryption.

While researching my talk, "A privacy first web-based period tracker? Is it even possible?" I came across the Blockstack framework and jumped on the opportunity to participate in their "Can't be evil"-competition.

So this fall, I launched POW! in open beta.

My goal is to celebrate International Women's Day (March 8th, 2020) with a robust version 1.

## @raae/gatsby-remark-oembed

In the fall of 2018 I released my first open source project. Its been a blast with contribution already from Thailand, Canada and the UK.

The project is a plugin for GatsbyJS that lets you embed content from Twitter, CodePen, YouTube, Instagram, SoundCloud and more using the oembed protocol.

I do a live broadcast every Monday.

At the end of May I was a guest on [Gatsby's webinar about plugins](https://youtu.be/QIhrbJcqKu4?t=1631). I talked about my experience creating @raae/gatsby-remark-oembed.

Topics I have knowledge about include: Apps (both native, hybrid and web), the JAMStack (Gatsby - Netlify - Stripe), Creating an open source project, Building MVPs in record time, Structured content, Learning through side projects and the oEmbed protocol.

If you need someone to give a talk or conduct a workshop on any of these topics [let me know](mailto://raae@raae.codes).

## Client work

I have been working as an independent contractor since 2010. These days I focus on making web apps with a visualization component.

I have experience with a myriad of technologies, but these days I focus on **React**, **Gatsby** and **D3**.

Currently I am creating a web app for Thales to help monitor and visualize tactical defense networks.

From the fall of 2013 to the spring of 2019 I made and maintained the Varsom app for The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate. First as a native iOS app, but later as a hybrid app on both Android and iOS.

I am available for long term 60% contracts from the fall of 2021, preferably as part of a remote first team.
