# Speaking

In 2019 I <del>would like to get</del> have gotten serious about speaking!

This fall I will be speaking at [Javazone](https://2019.javazone.no/program/15cea85e-03ca-4929-a6b3-fdb91558c24f), [JSConf Budapest](https://jsconfbp.com/speakers/benedicte_raae/), [RuhrJS](https://ruhrjs.de/speakers/benedicte-raae) and Mobile Era. The talk is titled "A privacy first web based period tracker? Is it even possible?". You can [follow my journey there](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1130526382541479936) on Twitter. I do a live broadcast every Monday.

At the end of May I was a guest on [Gatsby's webinar about plugins](https://youtu.be/QIhrbJcqKu4?t=1631). I talked about my experience creating @raae/gatsby-remark-oembed.

Topics I have knowledge about include: Apps (both native, hybrid and web), the JAMStack (Gatsby - Netlify - Stripe), Creating an open source project, Building MVPs in record time, Structured content, Learning through side projects and the oEmbed protocol.

If you need someone to give a talk or conduct a workshop on any of these topics [let me know](mailto://raae@raae.codes).
