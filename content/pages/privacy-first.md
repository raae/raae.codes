# A privacy first period tracker? Is it even possible?

Thank you for coming to my talk!

In the process of researching this talk I created [POW! - take charge of your menstrual cycle](https://usepow.app). Its a very minimal proof of concept at the moment, but with the amount of support and interested there has been I have decided to focus on POW! as my side project going forward!

I am aiming for a proper launch March 8th 2020 and need engaged beta user to help shape the app. If you would like to be one let me know by sending an e-mail to [pow@raae.codes](mailto:pow@raae.codes?subject=I'm in and want to beta test POW!).

Check out the code on [Github](https://github.com/raae/pow-app) and the slides for the talk on [Slides.com](https://slides.com/raae/a-privacy-first-period-tracker).

The graphs are made with [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/HFpFpAZSUF5QJj2G5cmh3U).
