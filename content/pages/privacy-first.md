# A privacy first period tracker? Is it even possible?

Thank you for coming to my talk!

In the process of researching this talk I created [POW! - take charge of your menstrual cycle](https://usepow.app). I have decided to focus on POW! as my side project going forward and would love your support.

Upvoting POW! on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pow-3) can be done by all!

Check out the code on [Github](https://github.com/raae/pow-app) and the slide for the talk on [Slides.com](https://slides.com/raae/a-privacy-first-period-tracker).

If you are interested in the framework I mentioned for privacy first apps check out [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org).

Sign up for my [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/raae) if you would like to hear from me again.
