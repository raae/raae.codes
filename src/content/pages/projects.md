## POW! - take charge of your menstrual cycle

Creating a menstrual tracker app has been in the back of my mind for years. First, because I wanted something more straightforward and flexible, then later the lack of privacy afforded by existing apps got me curious about encryption.

While researching my talk, "A privacy first web-based period tracker? Is it even possible?" I came across the Blockstack framework and jumped on the opportunity to participate in their "Can't be evil"-competition.

So this fall, I launched POW! in open beta.

My goal is to celebrate International Women's Day (March 8th, 2020) with a robust version 1.

## @raae/gatsby-remark-oembed

In the fall of 2018 I released my first open source project. Its been a blast with contribution already from Thailand, Canada and the UK.

The project is a plugin for GatsbyJS that lets you embed content from Twitter, CodePen, YouTube, Instagram, SoundCloud and more using the oembed protocol.
