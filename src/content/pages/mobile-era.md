# A privacy first period tracker? Is it even possible?

Thank you for coming to my talk!

As I said I am creating [POW! - take charge of your menstrual cycle](https://usepow.app). Its a very minimal proof of concept at the moment, but with the amount of support and interested there has been I have decided to focus on POW! as my side project going forward.

I am aiming for a proper launch March 8th 2020!

If you would like stay in the loop about everything POW! shoot an email to [pow@raae.codes](mailto:pow@raae.codes?subject=I want to stay in the loop!).

Also please upvote [POW! on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). No menstruation experience needed...
